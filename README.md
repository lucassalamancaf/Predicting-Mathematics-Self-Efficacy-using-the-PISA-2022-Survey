# Predicting-Mathematics-Self-Efficacy-using-the-PISA-2022-Survey
This project analyzes PISA 2022 data to study and predict students’ mathematics self-efficacy (MATHEFF). It merges student–school datasets, selects conceptual variables, handles missingness, and builds ML models. The analysis compares OLS, penalized regressions, Random Forest, and XGBoost to identify key predictors of MATHEFF.
